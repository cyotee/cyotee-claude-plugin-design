# Create Project PRD (Product Requirements Document)

Use interactive Q&A to gather project requirements and generate the global PRD.md at the repository root.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check for Existing PRD

Look for existing PRD.md at the repository root. If it exists, ask user if they want to:
- Update/replace it
- Cancel

### Step 2: Interactive Requirements Gathering

Use AskUserQuestion to gather requirements in rounds. Ask 2-4 questions per round.

**Round 1 - Vision & Purpose:**
- What is the name of this project?
- In one sentence, what does this project do?
- What problem does it solve?
- Who are the target users?

**Round 2 - Scope & Goals:**
- What are the 3-5 key features or capabilities?
- What is explicitly OUT of scope (non-goals)?
- What are the success metrics?
- What is the timeline or milestone structure?

**Round 3 - Technical Context:**
- What are the key technical constraints?
- What external systems/protocols does this integrate with?
- What are the security requirements?
- What chains/networks will this deploy to?

**Round 4 - Development Approach:**
- What is the repository structure (monorepo, multi-layer)?
- What are the key dependencies or frameworks?
- What testing requirements exist?
- What documentation standards apply?

### Step 3: Generate PRD.md

Create PRD.md at the repository root with the gathered information:

```markdown
---
project: [Project Name]
version: 1.0
created: YYYY-MM-DD
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---

### Step 4: Confirm and Save

Show the user a summary of what was captured and confirm before writing:

```
# PRD Summary

Project: [Name]
Vision: [One sentence]
Key Features: [Count]
Target Networks: [List]

Write PRD.md to repository root? [Confirm/Edit/Cancel]
```

### Step 5: Initialize Task Structure

After creating PRD.md, ask if user wants to initialize the task management structure:

```
PRD.md created successfully.

Would you like to initialize the task management structure?
This will create tasks/INDEX.md and tasks/0/ template.

Run: /init
```
